## 🚀 Technologies Used

This project was developed using the following technologies:

### **HTML** 🏗️

- It was the main language used to structure the web page.
- I used a framework to build my `index.html` file with best practices and ensure responsiveness for mobile devices.
  
### **CSS** 🎨

- **ALL** styles and animations were created using this language.
- I designed different layouts depending on the device (responsive design).
- I used variables to implement both light and dark modes.

### **JavaScript** ⚡

- I used it to connect switches so that when one is activated, another can also be triggered.
- I created different classes to manage the light and dark themes.
- I implemented a dictionary with translations so the portfolio can be available in two languages.
